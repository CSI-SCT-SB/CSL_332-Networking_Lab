# NOTE
## These are two optional solutions for the 3rd experiment. 
## Each solution contains two parts :- Server part & Client part
## For the program to be run :
   1. Run the Server program First
   2. When the program shows that it is waiting for the client's response, start running the Client program.
   3. Otherwise connection cannot be established properly and program will be terminated.
